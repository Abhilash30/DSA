Linked lists
Singly linked lists (cant remove elements in between)
Head -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> none
if you want to make element 2 the new starting node you can do so in O(1) time, attach head to 2
Head -> 2 -> 3 -> none 
Doubly linked lists:
        H
None -> 1 -> 2 -> none
    <-    <-   <-
But here we can remove 2 and attach 1 to none
None -> 1 -> none
    <-    <-
